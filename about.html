            <p>
              Asian Parliamentary Debate features two teams, typically consisting of

              debate. One team assumes the role of the government (proposition) while
              the other takes the opposition side. Participants must construct
              arguments, through persuasive and logical discourse.

                Blackbox is a coding contest for teams of five. Each member starts solving a unique

                allowed.
